1. Create an entanglement between two qubits such that the results of both entangled qubits are different. 

--> 01  and 10

2. Using X gates and appropriate CNOTs generate theÂ result:

--> 11000

Start with all 5 qubits as 11111


3. Using X, H, and CNOTs arrive at the ~50/50  results of"
--> 11000 and 10100
